<p>
    My name is Zach Burke. This web site will be my portfolio of programs that I will write for the CSC 106 Computer <br>
    Programming course I am taking at the University of Rhode Island. This page was constructed using the HTML language. <br>
    Above are links to pages that will contain some of my other work. This work will consists of apps I will write and <br>
    other work I will do with Javascipts, as well as a page about myself. <br>
    Have fun exploring!
