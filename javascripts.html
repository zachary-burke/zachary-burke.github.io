    <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/burke_bitmoji/5797106672173056"> <img src="burke_bitmojipic.png"></a> <br>
    This is burke_bitmoji. This is a program of a bitmoji I made of myself. <br>
    <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/burke_dancingbitmoji/5874669218136064"> <img src="burke_dancingbitmojipic.png"></a> <br>
   This is burke_dancingbitmoji. This is a program written where my bitmoji will "dance" on the screen by being randomly <br>
   positioned in the box with the click of the restart button. <br>
    <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/burke_racingbitmoji/6320748648693760"> <img src="burke_racingbitmojipic.png"></a> <br>
   This is burke_racingbitmoji. This program is a race between my bitmoji, a frog I coded, and rabbit with buckteeth I coded. <br>
   The speeds of the racers is random on each race so the same result does not occur every race. <br>
    <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/burke_dancingbitmojifun/5290472765095936"> <img src="burke_dancingBitmojiFunpic.png"></a> <br>
   This is burke_dancingBitmojiFun. Similar to the first dancing program my bitmoji will "dance" however it can also be made <br>
   bigger or smaller proportionately using the "bitHeight" variable in the program. <br>
    <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/burke_racingbitmojifun/5085042264735744"> <img src="burke_racingBitmojiFunpic.png"></a> <br>
   This is burke_racingBitmojiFun. In this program, similar to the other racing one, it will race my bitmoji, a frog, and a bunny <br>
   This one differs from the other racing one because the sizes of the racers can be changed to make them bigger or smaller. <br>
    <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/burke_resizebitmoji/6193289352675328"> <img src="burke_resizeBitmojipic.png"></a> <br>
   This is burke_resizeBitmoji. In this program there are 4 different sizes of my bitmoji and when the mouse is clicked it <br>
   will draw a 5th size on the position of the mouse. It will do this as many times as the mouse is clicked until the program is restarted. <br>
    <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/burke_quiz/4712719663726592"> <img src="burke_QuizPic.png"></a> <br>
   This is burke_Quiz. This is a program where a quiz is generated about my bitmoji and is interactive. After a question is answered hit restart to get a new one. <br>
   <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/burke_follow/6406405657165824"> <img src="burke_FollowPic.png"></a> <br>
   This is burke_Follow. In this program my bitmoji will follow the mouse around the screen, but be careful! <br>

   show on the grid in an array format. <br>

   This is burke_bitmoji_line. In this program a random number of my bitmojis will be generated based on a random number. <br>
   When restarted a new numbers of bitmojis should be generated. A println is generated at the bottom to show what happens <br>
   when a number generated is not between 1 and 4, including those two numbers. It also tells how many are currently being generated. <br>
   <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/burke_drybitmoji/4542559165054976"> <img src="burke_DryBitmoji.png"></a> <br>
