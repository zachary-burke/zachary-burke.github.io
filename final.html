        <h1>Welcome to my Final Project Page!</h1>
<p>
   For my final project I created an educational program meant for younger kids who need help learning their shapes. <br>
   This program is quite easy to use. Once it is opened just select a shape to be drawn and then pick a color to trace <br>
   and hold the left mouse to draw with the color that was selected. The shape can be traced as many times and with <br>
   however many colors that is desired. When you want to have a fresh start on the shape click the clear button. When you <br>
   want to pick a new shape click the restart button and you will be back at the beginning to start the same process over <br>
   again. Have fun!
